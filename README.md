The user is given the opportunity to choose the size of the field, set initial conditions:

1. manually (by clicking on the cells)
2. automatic creation of a random grid

During the operation of the cellular automaton, it is possible to suspend work, after which it is possible to resume it. 
Also, after starting the machine, it is still possible to make changes to the grid manually.

The default rule:

$2748116_{10}$ = $000000000010100111101110110101000000000001010011110111011010100_{2}$

Cell's values:

    1 - black
    0 - white

The neighborhood is given by the following formula:

$s_{5}^{,}$ = $F_{Neumann}(s1, s2, s3, s4, s5)$
